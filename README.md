## Mandatory part

### How it works?




### The rules of the game


## Usage

The program can be ran in two ways:
```shell
$> ./
```
```shell
$> ./
```



You can use the rule **'make'** to compile the program and run it.
```shell
$> make 
```

With the rule **'make clean'** you can delete the program.
```shell
$> make clean
```
 
With the rules **'make fclean'** you can delete all the object files (*.o).
```shell
$> make fclean
```
